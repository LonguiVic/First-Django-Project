# First-Django-Project  -  User Registration

Hi! This is my first project using Django and a database. It's something very simple, just to try to understand more about how these systems work.

## How it works

This system is very simple and currently doesn't have many styles, it was developed just for curiosity and understanding about how Django works with Python.

The system is a register of users where the user will enter the name and age, shortly after that he will be redirected to another HTML page with the name of all the registered ones. Also, all records are sent to a database.
